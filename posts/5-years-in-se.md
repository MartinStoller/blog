# Five Years in Software Engineering: From Struggling Junior to Tech Lead and beyond
I’m approaching my five-year anniversary as a professional data/software engineer, and—by most external measures—my career has gone surprisingly well.
I say 'surprisingly' because, on paper, there wasn’t much pointing in that direction.

I didn’t study anything technical. I wrote my first line of code at the relatively late age of 24. My school grades were average, and I’ve almost never felt particularly gifted or “above average.” I also struggle to put in long hours of truly productive work.

And yet, five years later, I’ve grown from a shaky junior into a tech lead, taken on real responsibility, and built a career I genuinely enjoy.

This isn’t a victory lap, and it’s definitely not a “how to become a tech lead in 3 easy steps” story. Instead, it’s an honest look at what actually moved the needle for me—what worked, what didn’t, and which mistakes were oddly useful in hindsight.
If you’re early in your career, switching into tech late, or quietly wondering whether everyone else has some secret you missed, this might save you a few wrong turns.

## Year 0: How did I even end up here
During the statistics classes of my master’s degree in Sports Science & Biomechanics, I wrote my first line of code.
We used what I think we can all agree is the undisputed best programming language out there: MATLAB.

It took only a few weeks for me to realize that these were actually my favorite classes—ever. I genuinely enjoyed the homework. Every time I ran my program and it worked, I felt like a magician.
I was writing a script that sorted an array of integers using three nested loops, and I was absolutely on top of the world.

Looking back, that tiny moment contains the first lesson of this story: celebrate your daily wins and have fun.

Of course, it’s important to also have awareness for the things you are not doing well yet. But you need to allow yourself to be proud of what you already can do. As with most things, it’s about finding the right balance.
Programming can be incredibly frustrating—especially at the beginning. If you don’t find a way to enjoy the small victories, you’ll likely quit long before you ever get good at it.

I quickly started taking extra online courses and was lucky enough that one of my closest friends discovered programming as a hobby at the exact same time. Since luck plays a major role throughout this entire story—and I don’t want to spell it out every single time—I’ll mark moments like these with this emoji: ☘️
Whenever you see it, read: “See how much luck I had here again.”
And honestly, without my friend, programming would probably be “that thing I tried for three months and then dropped.”
I vividly remember multiple moments early on where I was so frustrated by a problem that I was ready to give up. The only thing that kept me going was knowing that he had already figured it out. If he could do it, then surely I could too.

After finishing university, both of us decided to try our luck as self-taught developers—and somehow, we both landed jobs.
(Try that again in today’s market ☘️.)

That’s how I started my first job as a Java backend developer at an IT consulting company.

## Year 1: A shaky start
Technically, I didn’t start as a Java developer, but with a six-month traineeship. And I have to admit: I didn’t do a great job.
At the time, my mindset was simple—just do all the tasks they give you as quickly as possible. That belief was based on two assumptions:
1. The more tickets I complete, the more I learn—as if each task automatically translated into a fixed amount of knowledge.
2. If I finished the traineeship quickly, I’d get staffed on a real customer project and finally become a “real” software developer, learning in a proper professional environment.

Thanks to the very favorable market conditions at the time, I did manage to land my first customer project in record time—before the traineeship had even officially ended (☘️).
That had nothing to do with technical strength, though. Trust me.

Looking back, I genuinely believe I was one of the weakest graduates of that trainee program.
In hindsight, the mistake is obvious: I should have solved far fewer tickets and gone much deeper. Understanding why things work matters far more than just getting them to work and moving on.
Luckily, I should get more chances to grow...

My first customer project was… memorable. It started out as a nightmare.
I was staffed as a junior Java developer, but on my first day I was told they didn’t actually need a Java developer. Instead, they needed someone to work **alone** on their 30,000+ line, completely undocumented PL/SQL codebase.
I had never even heard of PL/SQL.
For months, I had been taught how to build REST APIs with Java. Now I was expected to be the owner of SQL pipelines—without knowing what a pipeline even was, or what SQL could do beyond simple joins.

I did my best for about half a year, but I wasn’t happy—and I wasn’t making meaningful progress either.
That’s when I discovered a hidden strength of mine…

## Year 2: Creating Opportunities
…**communication**. Through a random coincidence (☘️), I had recently learned about Apache Spark and realized it might be exactly the right tool for the SQL disaster I had to work with. I asked my product owner for a meeting and laid out the problems with our current codebase—problems nobody on the team truly understood anymore.

A massive refactoring was inevitable anyway. And if we were going to do that, why not use a technology that actually fit the problem?

What I **wanted** to say was:

“Working with this codebase feels impossible. It's ridiculous you even staffed me on this. I can’t do this, and I’ll probably quit if nothing changes.”

What I **actually** said was:

“We have the following problems. Don’t worry—I have an idea how to solve them. I’ll take full responsibility and lead the entire refactoring.”

He didn't just agree, but thanked me for my constructive feedback and good idea.
And just like that, a project that had started as a disaster turned into one of the best experiences I’ve ever had at work.
As a junior developer, I suddenly had real responsibility. I got to work with an amazing technology, make fundamental architectural decisions, and lead the development of a major service.

There it was—my next chance to grow. And this time, I did not only take it. I created it.
I enjoyed this new role so much that, at some point, I realized I didn’t want to go back to classical backend development at all. Working with raw data—and lots of it—was what I wanted to do long term.
I was entering a world I probably never would have discovered if I’d been staffed as a Java developer as originally planned (☘️).

There’s one more important takeaway here: was I actually ready—with just a few months of experience—to take on such a massive project using a technology I had never worked with before?

Absolutely not.

But I grew into it. And in hindsight, the more important question is: what was the worst that could realistically have happened?

## Year 3: Becoming a Teacher
Unfortunately, this project came to an end after one and a half exciting years due to budget issues. Thankfully, I found my next project almost immediately—as a data engineer at a large bank.
On paper, it was the perfect follow-up. In reality, it was rather disappointing.

The project was heavily mismanaged and extremely bureaucratic. Beyond a few basic pipelines, there wasn’t much I could contribute. It often felt like 90% of my time was spent waiting—for access to data, cloud resources, or yet another approval.
But once again, I found a way to create my own opportunities to grow.

My employer was primarily focused on Java backend development. My gradual drift into data engineering had been somewhat accidental, but it made me stand out. So I approached my manager with an idea: offering internal data engineering courses for colleagues who were curious about the field.

He loved it.

Suddenly, the time I spent waiting for access rights at the bank became useful. I prepared workshops, explained concepts, answered questions, and helped others take their first steps into data engineering.
That’s when I discovered something unexpected: teaching forced me to understand things properly. Explaining why something works is very different from just making it work yourself—and it accelerated my own learning more than any project ever had.

Over the years, I’ve asked many of the strongest engineers I know what they believe is the most effective way to get really good. The answers were all different: conferences, side projects, books, teaching, open-source contributions.
For me personally, teaching is the clear winner. There’s even some science backing this up—the Feynman Technique describes exactly this effect.

Another realization during this year was just how important soft skills really are.
The cliché says engineers only need to be technically strong. I’d been told many times by mentors and coaches that this isn’t true—that communication and people skills matter just as much—but I never fully believed it. Probably because those skills came relatively easily to me, so I assumed they did for everyone.

Year three was when that illusion broke.

In a corporate environment, your hard skills are worth very little if you’re impossible to work with. You need both. And in many situations, soft skills matter more.
Yes, people like to bring up the Linus Torvalds example—brilliant, difficult, and somehow still successful. I can’t speak to that. I’ve never seen him work.

What I have seen multiple times, though, are technically strong people being let go because they were rude, uncooperative, unpopular, or simply unable to work on the things they were expected to work on.

I would deepen—and later confirm—this realization a year later, when I had to lead a team of engineers myself for the first time.

## Year 4: Tech Lead
After the disappointing project at the bank, I joined a new project at an engine manufacturing company. It started out promising: my first exposure to Databricks, plenty of modern, machine-learning-driven topics, and a healthy amount of responsibility, ownership, and freedom to make my own choices.

I also had something new: a technically very strong manager who became a mentor to me for a while.
Looking back, that’s probably another thing I did right in my career so far—recognizing when someone is better at something than I am, regardless of age, title, or seniority, and learning from them.

The software engineering world has no shortage of big egos. I’ve met many people who are so busy proving how great they are—and how much worse everyone else’s solutions are—that they stop learning altogether. In my experience, that mindset is one of the biggest growth killers there is.
This realization became especially clear to me on that project. From my perspective, much of the team fell into that category. After about a year, even though I could have stayed, I decided to move on. Neither my tasks nor my environment seemed to offer meaningful potential for growth anymore.

That leads to another lesson: you have to actively choose growth.

At some point, you’ll always have the option to stay in a comfortable team, doing familiar work with minimal effort. There’s nothing wrong with that path, and I’d never judge anyone for choosing it. But it should be obvious that it rarely leads to exceptional growth—either in skills or in career.
Choosing growth means deliberately avoiding the comfort of familiar problems and instead picking the scary unknown. The more often you do it, the better you get at handling uncertainty—but it never fully stops being scary.

As it turned out, moving on was exactly the right decision.

I almost immediately found my next project—this time as a Tech Lead for a prestigious consulting company. They were building price recommendation models and needed to migrate to Spark for scalability reasons. The existing team had no Spark experience, so they hired me.
During the interview, they asked a reasonable question: why did I believe I could fulfill a Tech Lead role when I had never officially been one before?
I told them about my coaching and teaching initiatives, about my very first customer project where I had led a large-scale refactoring, and about several situations across different projects where I had taken ownership and responsibility beyond my role.

It worked. Only three and a half years into my professional career, I landed my first Tech Lead position.

Thankfully, this project turned out to be amazing. I loved my team, and the problems we were working on were genuinely interesting.
It was a lot of work and pressure—probably a mix of having a lead role combined with the general consultancy work ethic.
I worked a ton. I learned a ton. And because I enjoyed it so much, I didn’t mind—at least at first.

As deadlines approached, the pressure increased even further. That taught me another important lesson:
There is such a thing as too much work—or at least too much pressure—for learning.

When you’re so busy that you no longer have time to think deeply about problems, and more importantly to reflect and refactor after implementing a solution, learning slows down—or stops entirely. The dangerous part is that this is hard to notice while it’s happening, because you’re too busy to reflect in the first place.
For me, thankfully, this phase was short, and we still delivered on time. But it’s something I’ll actively watch out for in the future.

## Year 5: Head of Data Engineering
After about half a year on that project, I was approached by the product owner and asked whether I’d consider switching jobs. They were very happy with my work and wanted me to stay beyond my limited contract.

I hadn’t considered that option at all—I was genuinely happy in my role as it was. But after thinking it through, I realized this could be a great opportunity.
When I told my employer that I was considering the switch, he asked me to give him some time to come back with a counteroffer.

The result was unexpected.

My company—until then focused almost exclusively on Java backend development and DevOps—offered to bootstrap a data engineering department.

With me as its head.

They immediately posted job openings for two senior data engineers and asked me to design and launch a trainee program for juniors as well, so we could start building the team right away.
Now, to be fair, becoming “Head of Data Engineering” isn’t exactly difficult when you’re the only data engineer in the company. But titles aside, it very clearly marked the beginning of a new chapter and I gladly took that chance...


# Takeaway
These are my personal takeaways—things I wish I could tell my past self. Most of them are already embedded in the story above, but here they are explicitly:

- **Don’t underestimate soft skills.** They are at least half the job—often more. Strong communication, empathy, and reliability amplify your technical skills; without them, even great technical ability has limited impact.

- **Don't just wait for chances**. Create your chances by being proactive. Don't keep your ideas to yourself. If you want more responsibility, ask for it. It'll likely be appreciated.

- **Learning is an active choice**. Something I wish I would have realized a bit sooner. For quite a while I assumed the learning would just happen while doing my regular work. But real growth occurs when you actively chase it. 

- **Focus on solutions, not problems.** As an engineer, your job is to solve problems. If every issue triggers frustration or panic, this might not be the right role for you. When discussing problems, try to communicate in an optimistic, solution-oriented way. Don’t be the person who only complains—be the person people turn to because you always have an idea.

- **Luck mattered—but you can influence it.** Many things happened quickly for me thanks to good timing and chance. Still, you can create surface area for luck by being proactive, curious, visible, and willing to take responsibility.

- **Don’t do it alone.** Look for friends, mentors, and colleagues who share your interests and learn together. It’s more effective—and much more fun—than trying to grind through everything on your own.

- **Consistency and passion beat raw intelligence.** My “secret weapons” weren’t extreme working hours or a high IQ. They were steady effort and genuine interest over time.

- **Stay humble.** Don’t get defensive when comparing your work to others’. You can learn something from almost anyone if you’re open to it.

- At the same time: **be brave**. Be ambitious and confident when opportunities arise—even if you don’t feel fully ready. You’ll grow into them, and if you don’t, you’ll still learn. I recently read advice from a Siemens board member that stuck with me:
“You don’t have to be perfect to lead. Just be brave.”

- **Be outcome-focused at work.** Based on the feedback I received, this worked very well for me. Best practices and theory matter—and I’ve certainly ignored them too much at times—but companies ultimately pay you to solve problems, not to write the most beautiful code in their history. As always, it’s about balance: good quality and meaningful output.

- **Don’t be outcome-focused when you want to learn.** This was probably the biggest mistake throughout the first half of my journey. Real learning happens when you go deep instead of stopping the moment something works. Finding the right balance between this and the point above is hard, which is why I consciously separate the two: at work, I allow myself to be more output-driven; outside of work, I create space for depth—by teaching, writing about things I’ve built, reflecting on decisions, or analyzing them over lunch with colleagues.

- **Changing environments accelerates learning**. Ending up in IT consulting was fairly random, but it turned out to be a blessing. Frequently changing projects, teams, and problem domains boosted my learning curve significantly. There are other paths—but I strongly recommend varying your challenges early on.

- **Find the learning technique that fits you**. For me, teaching worked best. For others, it might be something else. But learning how to learn effectively makes all the difference.

- **Don’t be fooled by the highlight reel.** I focused mostly on positive stories here, but I made plenty of bad decisions too. I had months where I was unmotivated and did the bare minimum. I communicated poorly at times and made foolish choices in more ways than I’d like to admit. The point is: you don’t need to optimize your career every single day. If you have good months, you can afford bad ones too.
