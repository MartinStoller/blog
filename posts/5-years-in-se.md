# Reflecting on 5 Years of Software Engineering: From Struggling Junior to Tech Lead and beyond
I’m approaching my five-year anniversary as a professional data/software engineer, and—by most external measures—my career has gone surprisingly well.
I say 'surprisingly' because, on paper, there wasn’t much pointing in that direction.

I didn’t study anything technical. I wrote my first line of code at the relatively late age of 24. My school grades were average, and I’ve almost never felt particularly gifted or “above average.” I also struggle to put in more than ~35 hours of truly productive work per week (please don’t forward this to my boss).

And yet, five years later, I’ve grown from a shaky junior into a tech lead, taken on real responsibility, and built a career I genuinely enjoy.

This isn’t a victory lap, and it’s definitely not a “how to become a tech lead in 5 easy steps” story. Instead, it’s an honest look at what actually moved the needle for me—what worked, what didn’t, and which mistakes were oddly useful in hindsight.
If you’re early in your career, switching into tech late, or quietly wondering whether everyone else has some secret you missed, this might save you a few wrong turns.

## Year 0: How did I even end up here
During the statistics classes of my master’s degree in Sports Science & Biomechanics, I wrote my first line of code.
We used what I think we can all agree is the undisputed best programming language out there: MATLAB.

It took only a few weeks for me to realize that these were actually my favorite classes—ever. I genuinely enjoyed the homework. Every time I ran my program and it worked, I felt like a magician.
I was writing a script that sorted an array of integers using three nested loops, and I was absolutely on top of the world.

Looking back, that tiny moment contains the first lesson of this story: celebrate your daily wins and have fun.

Of course, it’s important to also have awareness for the things you are not doing well yet. But you need to allow yourself to be proud of what you already can do. As with most things, it’s about finding the right balance.
Programming can be incredibly frustrating—especially at the beginning. If you don’t find a way to enjoy the small victories, you’ll likely quit long before you ever get good at it.

I quickly started taking extra online courses and was lucky enough that one of my closest friends discovered programming as a hobby at the exact same time. Since luck plays a major role throughout this entire story—and I don’t want to spell it out every single time—I’ll mark moments like these with this emoji: ☘️
Whenever you see it, read: “See how much luck I had here again.”
And honestly, without my friend, programming would probably be “that thing I tried for three months and then dropped.”
I vividly remember multiple moments early on where I was so frustrated by a problem that I was ready to give up. The only thing that kept me going was knowing that he had already figured it out. If he could do it, then surely I could too.

After finishing university, both of us decided to try our luck as self-taught developers—and somehow, we both landed jobs.
(Try that again in today’s market ☘️.)

That’s how I started my first job as a Java backend developer at an IT consulting company: Haeger Consulting.

## Year 1: A shaky start
Technically, I didn’t start as a Java developer, but with a six-month traineeship. And I have to admit: I didn’t do a great job.
At the time, my mindset was simple—just do all the tasks they give you as quickly as possible. That belief was based on two assumptions:
1. The more tickets I complete, the more I learn—as if each task automatically translated into a fixed amount of knowledge.
2. If I finished the traineeship quickly, I’d get staffed on a real customer project and finally become a “real” software developer, learning in a proper professional environment.

Thanks to the very favorable market conditions at the time, I did manage to land my first customer project in record time—before the traineeship had even officially ended (☘️).
That had nothing to do with technical strength, though. Trust me.

Looking back, I genuinely believe I was one of the weakest graduates of that trainee program.
In hindsight, the mistake is obvious: I should have solved far fewer tickets and gone much deeper. Understanding why things work matters far more than just getting them to work and moving on.
Luckily, I should get more chances to grow...

My first customer project was… memorable. It started out as a nightmare.
I was staffed as a junior Java developer, but on my first day I was told they didn’t actually need a Java developer. Instead, they needed someone to work **alone** on their 30,000+ line, completely undocumented PL/SQL codebase.
I had never even heard of PL/SQL.
For months, I had been taught how to build REST APIs with Java. Now I was expected to be the owner of SQL pipelines—without knowing what a pipeline even was, or what SQL could do beyond simple joins.

I did my best for about half a year, but I wasn’t happy—and I wasn’t making meaningful progress either.
That’s when I discovered a hidden strength of mine…

## Year 2: Literally getting paid for my hobby

## Year 3: Becoming a Teacher

## Year 4: Tech Lead

## Year 5: Head of Data Engineering




Lessons:
- Softskills > Hardskills
- Have friends that share your passion and pain
- Hard work > Intelligence
- Poker -> analytical thinking???
- Its my hobby and it genuienly interests me
- I am humble and can tell when others are better. Then I can learn with and from them.
- Degree is overestimated but not useless
- I am very effective (sometimes try to be too effective, though)
- Companies want results, not perfect Code
- I had time to learn: Simon kucher showed me that there is such a thing as too much work where you just resolve tickets with the tools you know but stop learning (Thomas). I think you have to find th esweet spot where you do have responsibility and pressure to perform well, but not so much that it paralizes your ability to reflect, learn and grow
- IT consulting -> steeper learning curve
- Everybody has their own learning technique. i asked the most impressive SEs i have ever met on what their secret is and the top 5 people i asked gave me 5 different answers: Reading Books, Just build stuff (doesnt work at all fo rme because i always stop as soon as soemthing works so i dont learn because i dont get deep enough), visit conferences, Open source contributions and for me: Teaching (see feyneman technique)
- Teaching became my secret weapon for learning. I have always been looking for this
- 2 good years can turn a lot around. I had roughly 2 years were i was lazy and had very bad approach. But it is incredible and everyone underestimates what you can achieve in a year. so if you lock in for 2 years, this can already make all the difference over a 5 year period
- I am not technically stronger than other colleagues of mine with same experience. I just had the luck and the people skills and maybe the right approach towards work (see coding as tool to achieve a real world goal instead of trying to write the theoretically perfect codebase, but still always be mindful of what i did wrong and what problems that caused and what patterns from shcool books i better shoul have used)
- You need luck (Ralf, found data engineering by accident which turned out to be in a boom 2 years later, even found a job at haeger which turned out to be a magnet for immense talent, bijay, marten, dominic, wie ich zu simon kucher kam (der typ vor mich hat sich übernommen beim verhandeln))
